But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!</p><p>When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.</p><p>Your goal in this kata is to create complete the <code>mouth_size</code> method this method takes one argument <code>animal</code> which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an <code>alligator</code> (case-insensitive) return <code>small</code> otherwise return <code>wide</code>.</p>
